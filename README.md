## Summary

A package to mark resources for disposal upon definition, simplifying your code. For a full feature set, please refer to the [API reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/df_will_dispose/).

## Quickstart

1. Use `WillDisposeState` instead of `State` for your widgets, or simply mix in `DisposeMixin` and `WillDisposeMixin` to your existing state classes.
2. Define your resources using the `willDispose` function, which will automatically dispose of the resource when the widget is disposed.
3. Only `ChangeNotifier` and `DisposeMixin` resources are supported at the moment.
4. Common `ChangeNotifier` resources include `ValueNotifier`, `FocusNode`, most all Flutter controllers and [Pods](https://pub.dev/packages/df_pod).
5. You can also create your own classes that implement `DisposeMixin`, enabling them to work seamlessly with `WillDisposeMixin`.

### Example:

```dart
// Option 1: WillDisposeState<MyWidget>.
// Option 2: State<MyWidget> with DisposeMixin, WillDisposeMixin.
class _MyWidgetState extends WillDisposeState<MyWidget> {
  // Define and mark resources for disposal on the same line.
  late final _textController = willDispose(TextEditingController());
  late final _valueNotifier = willDispose(ValueNotifier('Initial Value'));

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('WillDispose Example')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          TextField(controller: _textController),
          ValueListenableBuilder<String>(
            valueListenable: _valueNotifier,
            builder: (context, value, child) => Text('Value: $value'),
          ),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              _valueNotifier.value = 'Updated Value';
            },
            child: const Text('Update Value'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Resources marked with `willDispose` will be disposed automatically here.
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

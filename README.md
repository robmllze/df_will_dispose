## Summary

This package provides a lightweight solution for managing the cancellation and disposal of resources in Flutter. It's designed to streamline your code by allowing you to mark resources for cancellation or disposal at the time of their definition. The package includes both `WillDispose` and `WillCancel` utilities, which work similarly but target different types of resources: `WillDispose` for disposables like controllers and notifiers, and `WillCancel` for cancellables like stream subscriptions.

## Quickstart

- Use this package as a dependency by adding it to your `pubspec.yaml` file (see here).
- For stateful widgets, use `WillDisposeState` or `WillCancelState` instead of `State`, or simply mix in `DisposeMixin` and `WillDisposeMixin` or `CancelMixin`, and `WillCancelMixin` to your existing state classes.
- Define your resources using the `willDispose` or `willCancel` functions, which will automatically dispose of or cancel the resource when the widget is removed from the widget tree.
- Any resource with a `dispose()` or `cancel() `method can be managed. If a resource does not have the appropriate method, `NoDisposeMethodDebugError` or `NoCancelMethodDebugError` will be thrown during disposal or cancellation.
- Common disposable resources include `ChangeNotifier`, `ValueNotifier`, `FocusNode`, most Flutter controllers, and `Pods`. Common cancellable resources include the `StreamSubscription`, `CancelableOperation` and the `Timer`.
- You can also create your own classes that implement `DisposeMixin` or `CancelMixin`, enabling them to work seamlessly with `WillDisposeMixin` and `WillCancelMixin`.
- For your convenience, here are [simplified versions](https://github.com/robmllze/df_will_dispose/blob/main/copy_me/) of the mixins that you can directly copy to your project if you'd prefer not to include this dependency.

### Example 1 - Mixins:

`DisposeMixin` and `WillDisposeMixin` can be applied to any class to efficiently manage disposable resources. For `StatefulWidget`, you can further simplify your code by using `WillDisposeState` instead of `State`. These mixins allow you to easily mark resources like `TextEditingController` and `ValueNotifier` for automatic disposal when the widget is removed from the widget tree. This approach ensures that all resources are properly cleaned up without requiring manual intervention, streamlining resource management in your stateful widgets.

```dart
class _CounterState extends WillDisposeState<Counter> {
  // Define resources and schedule them to be disposed when this widget ia
  // removed from the widget tree.
  late final _secondsRemaining = willDispose(ValueNotifier<int>(60));
  late final _tickCounter = willDispose(ValueNotifier<int>(0));
  late final _timer = willDispose(
    Timer.periodic(
      const Duration(seconds: 1),
      _onTick,
    ),
  );

  void _onTick(Timer timer) {
    if (_secondsRemaining.value > 0) {
      _secondsRemaining.value--;
      _tickCounter.value++;
    } else {
      timer.cancel();
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        ValueListenableBuilder<int>(
          valueListenable: _secondsRemaining,
          builder: (context, value, child) {
            return Text(
              '$value seconds remaining',
              style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            );
          },
        ),
        const SizedBox(height: 20),
        ValueListenableBuilder<int>(
          valueListenable: _tickCounter,
          builder: (context, value, child) {
            return Text(
              'Ticks: $value',
              style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            );
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
```

### Example 2 - BuildContext:

In some cases, you may prefer or need to manage disposable resources within a `StatelessWidget`, or you might use a `StatefulWidget` but you don't want to incorporate the mixins. The `willDispose` method can still be used effectively in these scenarios by leveraging the `BuildContext`.

```dart
class ChatBox extends StatelessWidget {
  const ChatBox({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Define resources and schedule them to be disposed when this widget is
    // removed from the widget tree.
    final textEditingController = context.willDispose(TextEditingController());
    final focusNode = context.willDispose(FocusNode());

    return Row(
      children: [
        TextField(
          controller: textEditingController,
          focusNode: focusNode,
        ),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            final text = textEditingController.text;
              print('Submitted: $text');
            textEditingController.clear();
            focusNode.requestFocus();
          },
          child: const Text('Submit!'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```
